# BooleanSolver

## Introduction

This is a python project to help developers with boolean expression during our coding. Sometimes we need to crack a problem logic by combining boolean operators such as: 'and', 'or' & 'not'. We as humans are prone to err, especialy when expression get big and clucky. Therefore is a algorithm (Quine-McCluskey) to get this expression for you with zero error. Just specify your requirement in a test and set a dummy function on your code. When you run your tests a solver will take your requeriments and code them in a simple boolean expression. After it will run tests to make sure that the new code is fine, enjoy:)
